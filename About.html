                    <p>Prakruthi institute of  Agriculture science and technology (PIA)(JSU/Reg/21/074), affiliated with J.S University, Shikohabad, Firozabad District, Uttar Pradesh (U.P). Under the Aadhya Educational Society (Reg No:559/2021). 
                    Starting an Agriculture college is a vision for our society. Agriculture plays a vital role in living life. One can't sustain their life without agriculture as it gives the most usable products of human life, such as food, fruits, oil, etc. 
                    The most crucial aspect of agriculture for human beings is to provide food for people. As we all know, food is essential for survival; nothing comes before food in sustaining life. Food is an integral part of everyone's livelihood, so we can say that agriculture is significant because it is our primary source of food supply. 
                    It is also the backbone of our economic system. Agriculture provides food, raw materials, and employment opportunities to a large proportion of the population. We are dedicated to looking for a critical equilibrium between production and conservation daily for one unifying purpose.</p></center>
